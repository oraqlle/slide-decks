# Structured C++

This is a [reveal.js] slide-deck for a workshop I gave to Monash DeepNeuron (fellow) members in January of 2024. The workshop was an overview of how C++ classes/types work and looked at everything from how data is laid in memory for custom types in C++ as well as some of the forms of polymorphism C++ is capable of.
