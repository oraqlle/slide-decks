                        During this meetup we will be discussing how to define our own types in C++ using classes
                        and structures. This will involve looking at how C++ structures data in memory by created
                        basic aggregations. We will then briefly look at how to hide parts of a type to users of
                        the type followed by looking at how to define operations on our custom types. We will
                        then look at how to control the lifetime of our types and bind the lifetime or resources
                        our type owns to the lifetime of the containing class itself using RAII. At the end we
                        will look at some extra properties possessed by classes and highlight how they can be
                        useful.

                            ## Some Terminology

                            When I refer to an *"object"* I am refer to a piece of data that lives in memory ie. the
                            actual 1s and 0s that make up the piece of data. An object has *some* value which is
                            of *some* type.

                        <textarea data-template>
                            ## Some Terminology

                            A *"value"* is the interpretation of some collection of bits according to a type. What
                            this means is that the same set of bits *might* have different meanings depending on
                            whatever type they are bound by.

                            <!-- Diagram illustrating this example: the bits `11110010011011010101111010111101` have the
                            value `-227713347` when interpreted as a C `int` but have the value `4067253949` when
                            interpreted as a C `unsigned int`. -->

                            ## Some Terminology

                            The *"type"* of some value is an abstraction within the programming language which constrains
                            what operations and values an object can have. This includes built-in data types like `int`,
                            `float`, `char` etc., often called POD (Plain Old Data) types in C++ as well as user-defined
                            types introduced using the `class` and `struct` keywords.

                            When referring to an *"identifier"* I am referring to the in-source name given to datums (variables),
                            free functions and member functions.

                            core libraries used to make a complete OS and the architecture of the CPU used to run the system.

                            some source code.

                        First we will look at how to build the basic structures in C++. These are known as aggregates
                        and they are just an amalgamation of data. We can declared them with the `struct` or `class`
                        keywords.

                        We won't use the `class` keyword for now due to it having some different default access
                        permissions to `struct` which will be discussed [later](#access-control).

                            using the <code>sizeof</code> operator we can see that our structures size is 12 bytes, not

                        <h3>Padding</h3>
                        
                        <p>
                            In some situations the compiler may add empty bytes; known as padding, around member variables
                            of a structure so that it is <i>"byte aligned"</i> or <i>"naturally aligned"</i>. This is done
                            to help optimises the CPU's ability to read and write to the address the member is located at.
                        </p>

                        <p style="font-size: xx-large;">
                            <i>Natural Alignment</i> means that a objects' starting memory address is a multiple of its size
                            in bytes.

                            The CPU will always accesses memory by a single memory word at a time. Let's see how padding affects
                            how the CPU accesses memory when reading in a fixed size word with our <code>A</code> type.
                        </p>

                        <aside class="notes">
                            This means that the largest primitive data type supported by the computer must be able to fit into the
                            size of a memory word otherwise the CPU would have to access a single data type in chunks causing the
                            CPU to have to coordinate between two memory pages. Luckily most, if not all systems behave have a memory
                            word size that is at least as large as its largest supported primitive type.

                            However, when dealing structured data we often have data with different sizes. If they are packed
                            tightly together, the memory can become misaligned resulting in the split memory access issues mention
                            before. We can see this in our `A` type.

                            Misaligned memory causes the CPU to fetch partial data meaning it need to find the missing data.

                        <aside class="notes">
                            Let's say we want to access each member of an instance of `A` and the members are packed right next to
                            each other. First the CPU with fetch the first full memory word size (assumed to be 64-bits or 8 bytes)
                            which will retrieve all of `chr`, `num` and only 3 bytes of `dec`, losing the rest. In order to operate
                            on `dec` the CPU would have to verify if the remaining bytes are available in its cache; as it may have
                            been lost along, retrieve them if they are not; performing a full RAM access request which is very costly
                            when you have the rest of the data ready, and combine it with the existing data of `dec`. This would
                            require lots of complex circuitry to achieve.

                            The compiler will add 3 bytes of padding after <code>chr</code> so that <code>dec</code> is naturally
                            aligned on the 32-bit boundary.
                        </p>

                            Instead, compilers will add padding so that certain datums start at some power-of-2 memory address
                            boundary. In this case, the compiler add 3 bytes of padding after `chr` so that any data for the member
                            `dec` is pushed out of the memory word containing `chr` and `num` which means the data of `dec` is not
                            split across memory words. This makes `num` now live on the 32-bit boundary line and `dec` on the
                            64-bit boundary line.

                            Now the CPU has a much easier time access memory correctly.

                            This dramatically reduced the logic the CPU needs to perform as it simply just fetches performs
                            another access to the needed datum (`dec`) and it can guarantee it will all be there. This is
                            a common theme in the relationship between software and hardware. Often by making certain things
                            true to the benefit of the hardwares design we can dramatically improve the performance of our
                            software.

                            But how does the compiler <i>know</i> what shape to give a programming language's types and structures in memory?
                            To understand this we will need to look at how two programs interact.

                            The symbols you use from other modules form an Application Programming Interface (API) between your source

                            When building a library you will often expose certain *symbols* which can be used in the source code of a

                            language these two programs are written in, creating the interface in which these two source code program
                            modules can interact with each other. This is know as an API (Application Programming Interface).

                            The compiled version of an API is what is known as the ABI (Application Binary Interface). An ABI is how
                            two binary program modules (ie. compiled source code) interact with each other. The ABI is usually defined
                            and implemented by compilers and describes how function/subroutines are executed, how types and structures
                            get mapped to memory etc. in a systems machine code.
